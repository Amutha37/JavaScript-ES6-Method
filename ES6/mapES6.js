// ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

// Why creating a new array is a good practise
// When the code base is small, we tend to perform all the actions on the same data structure and feel free to change it easily because we know wherever it is being used, but when the code base becomes huge and we are not sure whether a given data structure is being used at other place or not, it is not good to change it directly as it might lead to some inconsistencies at the other places where it is being used
// Generally, we try not to mutate any given data structure, because itâ€™s possible that the given data structure could have been used in some other place as well and changing it might break our code.
// The map helper comes to the rescue at such places, it applies a particular function to each element in an array and returns a new array without changing the original one.

const nums = [2, 7, 9, 171, 52, 33, 14];

const toSquare = (num) => num * num;

// const squareNums = (arr) => arr.map(toSquare);

// Using an anonymous function:
const squareNums = (arr) => arr.map((e) => e * e);

// As a function declaration plus using our named function:
// function squareNums(arr) {
//     return arr.map(toSquare)
// }
console.log(squareNums(nums));
